No More Donations for Commercial Use

I’ve gone through and removed all options to pay for commercial use. Although I still ask that you do not re-sale the font files themselves, I no longer request money for commercial use of any fonts. If you see any that I have missed, feel free to let me know.

When I get a chance, I will be redoing the site to not require going through the check out at all to download the fonts, but that’s easier said than done at the moment.

Hello, does this mean we can use the fonts free of charge? Sorry if I have misunderstood.

Thank you!

Yes, that’s what it means. I still ask that you don’t re-sell them, but you can use them in other commercial works without payment.
